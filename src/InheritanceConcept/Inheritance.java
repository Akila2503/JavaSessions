    // Inheriting some properties from parent to child is called Inheritance
       // Child can inheriting properties from parent class
       // But parent cannot inherit properties from child

    //Syntax for creating child class:

/*     class child_class_name extends parent_class_name
       {

       }

    // Types of Inheritance:
   
       // 1. SingleLevel Inheritance
       // 2. MultiLevel Inheritance 
       // 3. Multiple Inheritance
              //* Java does not support multiple inheritance
              //* With n number of parent we cannot create child
              //* In order to achieve this we use 'Interface'
